I structured my code using the MVC pattern to ensure clarity and separation of concerns. 
The controller handles HTTP requests, the service manages business logic, the repository 
deals with data storage, and the model defines the product entity. I applied clean code 
principles like meaningful method names, dependency injection, and proper annotations 
(```@Autowired```, ```@Controller```). However, input validation is missing in 
```ProductController``` and templates, which could lead to invalid data. Adding validation 
constraints and exception handling would improve data integrity and security.
